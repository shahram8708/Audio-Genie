# Audio Genie ðŸ¤–

Audio Genie is a Flask-based web application designed to analyze and generate insights from audio files. It utilizes Googleâ€™s Generative AI to process and create content based on user-uploaded audio files. This application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading audio files, adding custom prompts, and receiving processed content in Markdown format.

## Features

- **Audio Upload**: Upload audio files directly from your device.
- **Custom Prompts**: Add custom text prompts to guide the content generation.
- **Content Generation**: Generate insightful content based on the uploaded audio.
- **Markdown Rendering**: View the generated content in a formatted Markdown preview.
- **Interactive Elements**: Copy content to clipboard, read aloud with text-to-speech, and stop audio playback.

## Getting Started

    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the API key for Google Generative AI:

    ```sh
    export API_KEY='your_google_generative_ai_api_key'  # On Windows use `set API_KEY=your_google_generative_ai_api_key`
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

### Usage

2. **Add Custom Prompt**: Enter any specific instructions or questions in the textarea.
3. **Analyze Audio**: Click the "Analyze Audio" button to upload the file and process it.
4. **View Results**: The generated content will be displayed in Markdown format below the upload section.
